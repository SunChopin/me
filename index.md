## About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. student at Faculty of Information Technology at [University of Jyväskylä](https://www.jyu.fi/it/fi), supervised by [Prof. Timo Hämäläinen](http://users.jyu.fi/~timoh/). Meanwhile, I also work closely with [Prof. Hongkai Wang](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/2014011045/en/index.htm). I obtained M.E. in Biomedical Engineering and B.E. in Mechanical Engineering from [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/) and [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/), respectively. 

**I am looking for the industrial position as data scientist or machine learning engineer.**

## Research Interests

Medical Image Analysis, Machine Learning, Computational Anatomy Modelling.

## Project Experience 

- **Research Collaborator with Siemens Shanghai Medical Equipment Company Ltd, Shanghai China**
  <br>
  Participation in development of fully automatic diagnosis scanner system for Siemens Healthineers. My role included developing and validating data-driven pipeline for estimating major organ location from outer body surface.
