## About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. student at Faculty of Information Technology at [University of Jyväskylä](https://www.jyu.fi/it/fi), supervised by [Prof. Timo Hämäläinen](http://users.jyu.fi/~timoh/). Meanwhile, I also work closely with [Prof. Hongkai Wang](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/2014011045/en/index.htm). I obtained M.E. in Biomedical Engineering and B.E. in Mechanical Engineering from [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/) and [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/), respectively. 

## Research Interests

**Medical Image Analysis, Machine Learning, Computational Anatomy Modelling.** 

## Project Experience 

- **Research Collaborator with Siemens Shanghai Medical Equipment Company Ltd, Shanghai China**
  <br>
  Participation in development of fully automatic diagnosis scanner system for Siemens Healthineers. My role included developing and validating data-driven pipeline for estimating major organ location from outer body surface.
  <br>

- **Research Collaborator with INTESIM Company Ltd, Dalian China**
  <br>
  Participation in biomechanical simulation for designing population-oriented ergonomic device. My role included developing a finite element spine model incorporating adjustable shape deformation and material distribution parameters learned from image dataset.
  <br>
 
 - **Research Collaborator with BOE Healthcare Company Ltd, Beijing China**
  <br>
  Participation in development of mobile app (translation in ”digital body”, available in Apple Store) for customized healthcare service platform. My role included developing a digital twin generation pipeline of whole-body anatomy given user’s metadata (height, weight and BMI) for 3D visualization in assisting interpretation of medical examination report.
